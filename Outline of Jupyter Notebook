#Introduction:
My project will analysis how well smaller Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) fighters can perform against larger ones baed on the results of three BJJ tournament open-weight divisions: FIVE Grappling, IBJJF 2018 Worlds, and SJJIF 2018. I can then determine what factors affect the analysis results; these factors could be belt level, age division, or gender. I started by gathering all my data sets where were copy and pasted into excel and then reformatted into a more parsible form. The stories for each dataset are below

#Five Grappling:
The first dataset that I worked on was the FIVE Grappling dataset. This one was officially chosen for the project on February 23rd and cleaned on April 13th. During the cleaning, I noticed a significant amount of missing weight divisions, so I found a participants bracket that gave me much of the missing data.

#IBJJF 2018 Worlds:
I am currently cleaning this data set; I began doing so April 18th. This one was officially chosen for the project on February 23rd. On April 14, it was discovered that the inital data set was incomplete, but other data files from the source website were able to complete it. 

#SJJIF 2018 Worlds:
I will clean this dataset after the IBJJF dataset. Like the other two, this one was officially chosen for the project on February 23rd. On April 14, it was discovered that the inital data set was incomplete, but other data files from the source website were able to complete it. 

#Mashing Together:
I plan on piecing these datasets together using Pandas. I would imagine the best way to link these together would be tournament name.

#Final Analysis:
The final analysis will be done using data visualization software per recommendation.
