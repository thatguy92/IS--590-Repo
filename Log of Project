The datasets were all found on February 3rd 2019 and selected for project use on February 21st 2019.
After consultation on April 7th, I realized that my data structure for my csv files was unparasable, so I 
had to do most of the cleaning/reformatting by hand rather than code.
On April 13th, I cleaned the FIVE Grappling Data set, to a more horizontal, rectangular format
Upon seeing the some weight classes for fighters could not be found  from the placement rankings of non-absolute weight classes,
I found a bracket data set that described many of them. Some of the fighters still could not be found. 
I assume that they entered only the open weight division and were not weighed in. On April 14th, upon seeing that
the IBJJF and SJJIF datasets were missing women's and No Gi data, I downloaded the relevant data from the source websites.
