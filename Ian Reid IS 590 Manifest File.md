#Master Markdown File
The goal of this markdown file is to serve as an outline of the layout of all the deliverables for the 590-OM final project.

### Intermediate Datasets 
Within a folder titled 590-OM, there are three folders- one for each dataset that I used. 

The 2018 FIVE Grappling Data folder provides a file titled 2018 FIVE Grappling Data.xlsx. This is the original data as copy and pasted from the source: http://mataleao.ca/docs/FIVE/2018_five_california3_Results.pdf.
