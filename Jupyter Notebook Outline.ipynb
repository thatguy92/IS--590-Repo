    "#Introduction:\n",
    "#My project will analysis how well smaller Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) fighters can perform against larger ones.\n",
    "#This analysis will use the results of three BJJ tournament open-weight divisions: FIVE Grappling, IBJJF 2018 Worlds, and SJJIF 2018. \n",
    "#I can then determine what factors affect the analysis results; these factors could be belt level, age division, or gender. \n",
    "#I started by gathering all my data sets where were copy and pasted into excel and then reformatted into a more parsible form. \n",
    "#The stories for each dataset are below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Five Grappling:\n",
    "#The first dataset that I worked on was the FIVE Grappling dataset. \n",
    "#This one was officially chosen for the project on February 23rd and cleaned on April 13th. \n",
    "#During the cleaning, I noticed a significant amount of missing weight divisions, so I found a participants bracket that gave me much of the missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#IBJJF 2018 Worlds:\n",
    "#I am currently cleaning this data set; I began doing so April 18th. \n",
    "#This one was officially chosen for the project on February 23rd. \n",
    "#On April 14, it was discovered that the inital data set was incomplete, but other data files from the source website were able to complete it. \n",
    "\n",
    "#SJJIF 2018 Worlds:\n",
    "#I will clean this dataset after the IBJJF dataset. \n",
    "#Like the other two, this one was officially chosen for the project on February 23rd. \n",
    "#On April 14, it was discovered that the inital data set was incomplete, but other data files from the source website were able to complete it. \n",
    "\n",
    "#Mashing Together:\n",
    "#I plan on piecing these datasets together using Pandas. \n",
    "#I would imagine the best way to link these together would be tournament name.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Final Analysis:\n",
    "#The final analysis will be done using data visualization software per recommendation."
